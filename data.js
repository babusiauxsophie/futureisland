    synopsis: "Everyone agreed after Gorillaz blew the roof off the Werchter stage in 2018 - the brainchild of comic artist Jamie Hewlett and Blur’s Damon Albarn is one of the best live acts ever. Some of the headlines: ‘So much grandeur’. ‘An infectious carnival’. ‘Dancing towards a better world’. Shortly afterwards, Albarn announced that we shouldn’t expect too much over the next ten years. Then in January this year, they presented the musical concept ‘Song Machine’. And next year, the first virtual band in history is heading back out on tour. From now on, Gorillaz will release music in episodes, whenever new material is ready. Each episode features a different guest:  in 2020 the likes of slowthai, Fatoumata Diaware, Peter Hook (New Order), Georgia and Octavian joined forces with the band",

     name: "Jamie xx",
     synopsis: "Jamie Smith, perhaps better known as Jamie xx, is one of the greatest musical minds of the 21st century. He is the visionary beatmaker who developed the blueprint for the melancholy indie pop of The xx. He is also a DJ with exceptional taste and an impressive musical knowledge. His sets are a parade of forgotten gems. ‘In Colour’ (2015), his first solo album, is the sum total of the two Jamies. It was a party album for the brain and the feet; for both the campfire and the dancefloor. It was a brilliant success, bagging nominations for the Brit Awards, Grammy Awards and many others. After that, he once again gave his undivided attention to The xx. However, the itch persisted, and this spring, the single ‘Idontknow’ gave us a glimpse of a sharper, more aggressive Jamie xx to come.",

     name: "Boy Pablo ",
     synopsis: "boy pablo hails from Bergen in Norway, renowned for being the rainiest city in Europe, with an average rainfall of 250 days a year. You’d think this would inevitably weigh on the mood of its inhabitants, but it seems to have had the opposite effect on Nicolas Pablo Muñoz. The young singer-songwriter with Chilean roots has the natural cheerfulness of Mac DeMarco, Ween or - to go a long way back in time - Jonathan Richman. Although he mostly writes and records his sunny indie pop alone, Pablo loves to perform live with four old school friends. His music found its way into the world with ‘Everytime’ (2017). The accompanying video has been watched more than 30 million times. In Norway, boy pablo is already a national hero, and the rest of the world is bound to follow with his debut album ‘Wachito Rico’ (2020).",

     name: "The Streets",
     synopsis: "The Streets is the musical venture of Mike Skinner, creator of the best British rap album of all time. In 2002 the – then – weekly NME magazine wrote the following prophetic words about Original Pirate Music, the debut album by The Streets. ‘Everybody knows that the future of dance music is on the streets. Now the future of dance music is The Streets.’ Skinner took social commentary and the street sound of the day – two-step and garage – and pressed them into a filthy, poetic mosaic. A hooligan in poet’s clothing. The next album A Grand Don’t Come For Free (2004) brought the hits Fit But You Know It and Dry Your Eyes. In 2011, Skinner shut up shop to work on films. But the good stuff always comes round again. His recent appearances at the AB and Pukkelpop – with an incredible band in tow – were right up there.",

     name: "Black Pumas",
     synopsis: "Imagine soul singer Sam Cooke and proto-rocker Neil Young in the Wu-Tang Clan hip hop collective. That should give you a rough idea of Black Pumas, a project run by an extraordinary duo from Austin, Texas. Adrian Quesada is in his forties and was once the guitarist for the nine-piece band Grupo Fantasma, winners of the Grammy for Best Latin Album in 2010. Quesada had a few instrumental tracks in his studio that were crying out for a soulful voice. Some friends recommended Eric Burton, a busker from downtown Austin, and the rest is history. The Black Pumas’ debut is just about flawless. Its psychedelic soul earned the two musicians the title of ‘breakout band of 2019’ in the US. Great stuff for anyone who has enjoyed Alabama Shakes, Durand Jones & The Indications or Curtis Harding at Werchter in recent years.",
